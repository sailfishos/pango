Description: |
    Pango is a library for laying out and rendering of text, with an emphasis
    on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed,
    though most of the work on Pango so far has been done in the context of the
    GTK+ widget toolkit. Pango forms the core of text and font handling for GTK+.
    
    Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout engine can be used
    with different font backends.
    
    The integration of Pango with Cairo provides a complete solution with high
    quality text handling and graphics rendering.
